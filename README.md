#### <u>Starting the tutorial</u>

I followed the instruction given on the https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt0. Followed the steps until I came to a point where I was trying to host my website. The command "aws s3 sync build/ s3://YOUR_S3_DEPLOY_BUCKET_NAME" does not work and it gives you the error file path does not exist. The solution was I manually uploaded the files in order to make the website up and running.
